# What is this?
This is a companion strategy guide to the [[notes/series-65-exam|NASAA Series 65 Exam]], otherwise known as the “Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam”. 

This guide is written for anyone looking to pass this exam as a pre-requisite to invest in pre-IPO startups as an angel investor. 

This guide is applicable to anyone looking to angel invest in U.S.-based startups, and don’t otherwise meet the other qualifications to be considered an [[notes/concepts/accredited-investor|accredited investor]]. 

*Note: Even if you’re a foreign investor, these still apply to you under United States securities laws.*

# Who wrote this and why?
My name is [Andric Tham](https://andrictham.com), and I’m a product manager / designer / angel investor. 

I started angel investing in 2021 while taking a sabbatical, and started studying the Series 65 in order to meet [[notes/concepts/accredited-investor|accredited investor]] qualifications.

As part of my study journey, I wrote a ton of notes in my Roam Research graph. The notes here are a synthesis of those notes. Hopefully they will help you pass the exam too!

Note that because I studied the exam between October 2021—February 2022, some of the information here might be outdated. If you encounter inaccuracies, please contact me for corrections (see section below).

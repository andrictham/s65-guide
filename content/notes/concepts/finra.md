FINRA is a self-regulatory organization, meaning it’s not part of the government, but a non-profit organization which is designated by the government to be an examining authority.

A designated examning authority is expected to regulate its own members, and inspects their books and records.

FINRA’s members are [[notes/concepts/broker-dealers|Broker-Dealers (BDs)]], and is responsible for their licensing and regulation.

> [!warning] Note
> 
> FINRA does not regulate [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs)]] or [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]]. That job falls to either the [[notes/concepts/sec|SEC]], or the relevant [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrator]].

The [[notes/concepts/sec|Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)]], a governmental body, oversees FINRA.

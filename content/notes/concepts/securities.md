A security is any investment product that can be **🔁 exchanged for value** _and_ **⚠️ involves risk**.
- It must be readily transferable between two parties
- The owner must be subject to the loss of some, or all, of the invested principal
- If the product is not transferable or does not contain risk, it is not a security.

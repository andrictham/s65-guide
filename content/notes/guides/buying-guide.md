# ðŸ“– Textbooks

## Recommended textbook
### [[notes/resources/kaplan|ðŸ“– Kaplan Series 65 Securities License Exam Manual]]
Kaplanâ€™s textbook and online question bank are designed to work together, and is the resource I most highly recommend as a resource for revision.

However, there are two downsides you should be aware of:
- It comes at a rather steep price
- Its textbook, while great for revision, tends to be written in an overly factual and instructive manner, making it a poor resource if youâ€™re new to the material.

If youâ€™re studying for the Series 65 not as a financial professional, but as an angel investor, you might want to pair this textbook with another, more beginner-friendly text (see alternative textbooks below).

## Alternative textbooks
Both of the following two textbooks are great resources for beginners.

### [[notes/resources/wiley|ðŸ“– Wiley Series 65 Exam Study Guide]]
	
This textbook is the more comprehensive of the two, and is better structured like a reference book. 

I recommend using Wiley for studying these two topics:
- [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]
- [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|Economic Factors and Business Information]]

### [[notes/resources/pass-the-65|ðŸ“– Pass the 65]]
This textbook is written in plain English, which may make it easier to grok than other textbooks. Its outstanding in the way it explains concepts that assume youâ€™re a complete beginner.

However, large chunks of it is written in long unending prose, which makes it unsuitable as an ongoing reference book for revision purposes.

I recommend using Pass the 65 for studying these two topics:
- [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|Investment Vehicle Characteristics]]
- [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]]

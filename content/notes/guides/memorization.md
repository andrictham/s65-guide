Think of this as a cheatsheet of the key things you‚Äôll definitely want to remember by heart. 

This exam is more like a law exam than a math exam, although there are some basic figures and formulas you‚Äôll need to remember. We‚Äôll list them all here, although this list is not guaranteed to be exhaustive. 

If you‚Äôve studied the exam well following the [[notes/guides/strategy-guide|Test Prep Strategy Guide]], then you should already be familiar with the items in this cheatsheet. 

Use this list to scan and commit to short-term memory a few hours before the exam.

# üßÆ Formulas
- Alpha
	- Depends on whether risk-free rate is given in the question
	- If risk-free rate is not given:
		- `(Actual Return) ‚Äì (Beta √ó Market Return)`
	- If risk-free rate is given:
		- `(Actual Return ‚Äì Risk Free Rate) ‚Äì (Beta √ó (Market Return ‚Äì RF))`
- Current Yield for [[notes/securities/bonds|Bonds]]
	- ` Current Yield = Annual Interest / Market Price`
- Current Yield for [[notes/securities/stocks|Stocks]]
	- `Current Yield = Annual Dividend / Market Price`
- Convertible Bonds
	- Number of shares for conversion, when converting a convertible bond
		- `Number of Shares for Conversion = Par Value / Conversion Price`
	- Conversion parity price
		- `Parity Price = Market Value of Bond / Conversion Ratio`
-   Time Value of Money
    - Present Value and Future Value
- After-Tax Return
	- This calculation lets you go from taxable yield to the tax-free equivalent
	- `Taxable yield * (100% - tax bracket)`
- Tax-Equivalent Yield
	- This calculation lets you go from tax-free yield to the taxable equivalent
	- `Taxable yield / (100% - tax bracket)`
- Rule of 72
	- The number of years it takes for a given investment to double (an estimate)
	- Divide 72 by the known interest rate
	- `Numner of years for investment to double = 72 / interest rate`
- Offsetting Gains with Losses (Tax Loss Harvesting)
	- Example: If you took a $945 gain with GE, and sell another stock at a $1,000 capital loss, you‚Äôd end up with zero capital gains for the year
	- Offsetting Ordinary Income with capital losses: You can use up to $3,000 of your total or net loss to offset (reduce) your adjusted gross income for the year. The excess over $3,000 can be carried over to following years
- Financial Measures Derived from Balance Sheet

# üß† Heuristics
- The **Credit Spread** describes the difference in yield between Bonds of similar maturity, but with different credit quality (junk bonds vs AAA bonds)
    -   üìâ üìà A **narrowing** credit spread signals confidence in the economy
    -   üìà üìâ A **widening** credit spread signals nervousness about the economy
- Bond Yields Seesaw
	![[notes/images/Pasted image 20220814200152.png]]
	- Discount bonds (<$1k) ‚Üí seesaw up
        -   Nominal Yield < Current Yield < YTM < YTC
    - Premium bonds (>$1k) ‚Üí seesaw down
        -   Nominal Yield > Current Yield > YTM > YTC

# üí¢ Exceptions
- Exception: [[notes/concepts/broker-dealers|Broker-Dealers (BDs)]] may use testimonials in communications but an [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Investment Adviser (IA)]] may never do so
-   Unlike with [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Investment Advisers (IAs)]], there is no de minimis exemption for [[notes/concepts/broker-dealers|Broker-Dealers (BDs)]]
- American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are traded in US dollars, but still hold currency risk as the underlying stock is denominated in a foreign currency
- Exemptions from regulation of [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Investment Advisers (IAs)]]: LATE (Lawyers, Accountants, Teachers, Engineers)
# ‚öñÔ∏è Dichotomies
There are certain concepts in the exam that are slightly different variants of each other, or are concepts that sound similar, that the exam will use to trick you. 

You must know the differences between:
- [[notes/concepts/exemptions-exclusions|Exemptions and Exclusions]]
- Discretion and Custody, in the context of net capital requirements for state-registered [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Investment Advisers (IAs)]]
	- for advisers with custody (whether with discretionary authority or not)
	- for advisers with no custody but with discretionary authority
- Surety Bond vs Fidelity Bond
	- Surety Bond: What an [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|investment adviser]] is required to post if they are unable to meet capital requirements
	- Fidelity Bond: [[notes/regulations/sipc-1970|SIPC]] members, which are [[notes/concepts/broker-dealers|broker-dealers]], must obtain this to protect customers against employee dishonesty 
- Control Persons
	- [[notes/regulations/securities-exchange-act-1934|The Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]: 10%
		- Control securities are owned by ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù: officers, directors, and owners of 10% or more of the company‚Äôs outstanding stock
	- [[notes/regulations/investment-company-act-1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]: >25%
		- A person is deemed to be a control person of a Management Investment Company when owning/controlling more than 25% of outstanding shares

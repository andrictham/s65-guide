In order to become [[notes/concepts/accredited-investor|accredited]], after passing the [[notes/series-65-exam|Series 65]], you will need to register as an [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representative (IAR)]], as well as register an [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|RIA]] firm. 

# When to register and renew

> [!warning] The Series 65 expires in two years unless you register with a state
> 
> You have two years to become _registered_ (licensed) with a state after passing the exam. Otherwise, your exam’s status will show as “expired” and you will need to retake the exam

> [!info] Licenses expire, and need renewing every year
> 
> You should already know this, as it’s covered in the exam, but it’s worth remembering that all state registrations expire and need renewing **December 31st** of every year. You must pay the renewal fee every year.

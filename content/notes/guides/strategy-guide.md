# üìö Buy a high-quality textbook and question bank
You‚Äôll want to buy a textbook and question bank to aid in your study. 

While it‚Äôs possible to fashion your study from free or cheap resources, it‚Äôs not recommended as you might be studying outdated information whenever the test is updated with new questions. 

Cheap question banks also aren‚Äôt particularly representative of what might show up in the exam. 

See [[notes/guides/buying-guide|Textbook & Question Bank Buying Guide]] for selecting a textbook and question bank.

When studying, you might also want to supplement textbooks with [[notes/resources/videos|videos]], which can help explicate unfamiliar topics.

# üóì Budget time to study
The exam is rich in material, so you‚Äôll want to make sure you‚Äôve cleared your schedule and can properly focus on studying. This isn‚Äôt an exam that can be passed with just a few weeks of revision, unless you‚Äôre already deeply familiar with the topics.

If you‚Äôve never worked in any capacity in finance, and are coming to this completely fresh, then you would want to budget about 3‚Äì4 months of full-time studying or 4‚Äì5 months part-time.

If you have had some experience as a trader or investor, and are familiar with [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|financial assets]] (like [[Stocks]], [[notes/securities/bonds]], [[Options]], [[Futures]], and [[Commodities]]) and [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|economics]] concepts, but you don‚Äôt have an in-depth understanding of [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|U.S. financial regulations]], then you could spend 2‚Äì3 months full-time, or 3‚Äì4 months part-time.

If you‚Äôve previously worked in finance, and are familiar with [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|U.S. financial regulations]], as well as common [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|financial assets]] and basic [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|economics]], you might be able to get away with spending just 1‚Äì2 months of revision armed with a good textbook, like the [[notes/resources/kaplan|üìñ Kaplan Series 65 Securities License Exam Manual]].

This is just a rule of thumb, however. Before commiting to a date for the exam, make sure you‚Äôre able to make progess at a comfortable pace, and factor in time you‚Äôll need to revise (3‚Äì4 weeks).

# ‚úåÔ∏è Split study into two phases
The exam is rich in concepts you have to deeply understand, as well as facts & figures you‚Äôll just have to memorize. 

We recommend splitting your study time into two phases: 
1. An initial study phase where ypu‚Äôre more concerned with deeply understanding the material, and dilligently notetaking followed by:
2. A revision phase about 3‚Äì4 weeks before the exam where you‚Äôre focused on memorizing facts & figures, as well as doing as many practice exam questions as possible

# üî¶ When revising, focus on highly-weighted topics
As you might have seen in the [[notes/topics/exam-outline|exam specifications]], not all topics are evenly weighted in the exam. 

As such, you shouldn‚Äôt focus your study and revision time equally on all topics, as many of them will take a long time to study but aren‚Äôt heavily tested. Some units, like [[Tax Considerations]] or [[Insurance-Based Products]], will only see two questions appear on your exam, whereas the material is rich in facts & figures to memorize. These topics are not the best use of your time, as opposed to those with four or more questions.

A simple trick to passing is to focus on revising those unis where most questions will appear, and out of those, those where you are most weak in.

The one topic you‚Äôll absolutely want to memorize cover-to-cover is [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines]]. This topic is rich in questions as well as facts & figures that need to be memorized, such as dates, figures, exclusions, and exemptions.

The other topics that I recommend focusing on during the revision phase are:  
- Calculations found in [[Financial Reporting]], [[Analytical Methods]], and [[Performance Measures]] (four questions each)
- The different types of plans and their differences, in [[Retirement Plans Including ERISA Issues and Educational Funding Programs]] (a total of seven questions)

# üî¢ Order to study each topic
Different [[notes/guides/buying-guide|textbooks]] present each of the four topics covered in the exam in a different order. There is no canonical order you should study in, since the concepts being tested are highly interweaved across all four topics.

When studying, you‚Äôll want to study in a way where concepts build on each other naturally. The way the topics are interweaved makes it difficult, but I‚Äôve found the most natural order to be:

1. [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|Investment Vehicle Characteristics]]
2. [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|Economic Factors and Business Information]]
3. [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]]
4. [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]

When revising, you‚Äôll want to prioritize topics that are more heavily tested, as mentioned above. This lends us to this particular order:

1. [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]
2. [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]]
3. [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|Investment Vehicle Characteristics]]
4. [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|Economic Factors and Business Information]]

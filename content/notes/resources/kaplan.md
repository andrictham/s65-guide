# How I used the Kaplan to study
I started using the Kaplan materials about a month before my exam, doing the practice tests for each section, the mock exam, and half of the weighted practice exams over the course of 3 weeks. 

By following their study calendar, you can customize your study time to any time (3 weeks is the shortest recommended time).

I ended up using up a quarter of the question bank toward the end of my revision. 
  
Each day, I used their performance tracker to track down parts I was weak in and marked them in the exam manual and revised the relevant parts. Kaplan breaks it down all the way to a ‚Äúlearning objective‚Äù, so it makes targeted revision super easy.
  
After going through test questions section-by-section for a week, I became used to the way the questions were phrased and their gotchas. I was consistently scoring 80%+ on the practice exams, and scored 74% on the mock exam (the mock exam is a one-off exam that is a little harder than the practice questions and doesn‚Äôt reuse any of the questions from the test bank).  
  
The actual test requires 73% to pass, so if you‚Äôre scoring higher than that on Kaplan, you should be good to go! The actual exam‚Äôs questions are phrased really similarly to the Kaplan practice questions, but they‚Äôre a lot easier than the Kaplan ones.

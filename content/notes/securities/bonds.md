# Components of a Bond
## Par Value
The “par value” of a bond is $1,000 (unless otherwise stated).

> - Principal Amount

Bonds are quoted as a percentage of par. 

For example, a bond priced at `105` is worth $1,050, or 105% of $1,000.

## Interest
The interest rate of a bond is how much it pays out in total every year, quoted as a percentage of par value.

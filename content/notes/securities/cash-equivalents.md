# What are cash equivalents, and why would investors hold them?
-   Purpose: Businesses use Cash and Equivalents as a buffer against bad times, or to make strategic acquisitions.
    -   The first line of a corporation’s [[Balance Sheet]] is “Cash and Equivalents,” listed under “Current Assets”.
    -   When a business invests its excess cash in short-term interest-bearing securities, they are investing in Money Market Securities as opposed to long-term bonds, to earn interest at a lower risk.
-   Definition: Money market securities are debt securities maturing one year or less.
    -   As opposed to: Debt securities maturing >1 year, which are sometimes called “[[Funded Debt]]”.
-   👉 Remember: The exam may refer to money market securities as “cash equivalents” because they are as good as cash.
-   ➕ Pros: Money Market Instruments are better than cash, because they are earning interest. It’s not a high interest, but you are not risking it in the stock or bond markets.
-   ➖ Cons:
    -   Money Market Instruments do not tend to keep pace with inflation
    -   The opportunity cost of cash: Investors miss out on opportunities if they hang onto too much cash, such as if the stock or bond market rallies.

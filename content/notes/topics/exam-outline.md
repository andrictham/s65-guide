In order to pass the [[notes/series-65-exam|NASAA Series 65 Exam]], you must pass 94 out of 130 scored questions, or 72%.

The questions in this exam are randomly picked from a bank of questions, based on a pre-defined probability distribution across different topics. 

As of August 2022, the exam questions are distributed between the four main topics in  this way:
1. [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|Economic Factors and Business Information]] â€” 15% â€” 20 questions
2. [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|Investment Vehicle Characteristics]] â€” 25% â€” 32 questions
3. [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]] â€” 30% â€” 39 questions
4. [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]  â€” 30% â€” 39 questions

The exact distribution of questions within each topic is published on the [[notes/concepts/nasaa|NASAA]] website, [here](https://www.nasaa.org/exams/exam-content-outlines/series-65-exam-content-outline/). As these can be updated now and then, we recommend going straight to the source for the test specification.

A good textbook, like the [[notes/resources/kaplan|ðŸ“– Kaplan Series 65 Securities License Exam Manual]], will be updated in a timely manner to keep pace with the latest changes to the exam questions.

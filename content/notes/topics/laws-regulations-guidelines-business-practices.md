# Key Concepts

## Securities
A [[notes/concepts/securities|security]] is any investment product that can be 🔁 exchanged for value __and__ ⚠️ involves risk, such as stocks, bonds, options, warrants, and more.

You will be expected to know which securities need to be registered with the [[notes/concepts/sec|Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)]] or [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrators]], and in which cases issuers or securities become [[notes/concepts/exemptions-exclusions|exempt or excluded]] from registration.

## Securities Professionals
This topic heavily focuses on concepts related to firms and individuals who are [securities professionals](/tags/securities-professionals), who are individuals and firms whose job it is to provide financial services related to [[notes/concepts/securities|securities]], for the benefit of their customers or owners based in the United States.

There are four main persons in the United States securities industry that the exam focuses on:
- [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs)]]
- [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]]
- [[notes/concepts/broker-dealers|Broker-Dealers (BDs)]]
- [[notes/concepts/agent|Agents]]

> [!warning] The meaning of “persons” in a legal context
> 
> In a legal context, a “person” may refer to a company or an individual. An individual is known as a “natural person”. 

## Regulatory Bodies
This topic also focuses on how these firms and individuals are regulated by [regulatory bodies](/tags/regulatory-bodies) based in the United States. These regulatory bodies may be a federal government authority (national level) or a state authority.

- [[notes/concepts/sec|Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)]]
- [[notes/concepts/finra|Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] 
- [[notes/concepts/nasaa|North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)]]
- [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrator]]
> [!info] The State Securities Administrator
> 
> Because the exam is designed to license [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]], which are regulated by [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrators]], the exam places a heavy focus on the role and jurisdiction of the [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrator]]

### Which regulatory bodies regulate each of the four [securities professionals](/tags/securities-professionals)?
- [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Investment Advisers (IAs)]] and [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]] are regulated by:

### Registering with regulatory bodies

{"/":{"title":"😇💰 Series 65 for Angels","content":"\n# What is this?\nThis is a companion guide / strategy guide to the [[notes/series-65-exam|NASAA Series 65 Exam]], otherwise known as the “Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam”. \n\nThis guide is written for anyone looking to pass this exam as a pre-requisite to invest in pre-IPO startups as an angel investor. \n\nBecause the exam was originally intended to license [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]], test prep resources you may find online are geared towards professionals working as IARs. This guide hopefully helps to fill in any conceptual gaps you might encounter while studying for this exam, if your professional background is not in investment advisory.\n\nThis guide is applicable to anyone looking to angel invest in U.S.-based startups, and don’t otherwise meet the other qualifications to be considered an “[[notes/concepts/accredited-investor|accredited investor]]”. Note: even if you’re a foreign investor, these still apply to you under United States securities laws.\n\n# New here?\n\u003e 📚 Get started with the [[notes/guides/master-guide|Master Guide]]\n\n# How to use this site\nThis site is organized as a digital garden: all notes are linked to each other and shown in an interactive graph visualization.

This isn’t an exam that can be passed with just a few weeks of revision, unless ypu’re already deeply familiar with the topics.\n\nIf you’ve never worked in any capacity in finance, and are coming to this completely fresh, then you would want to budget about 3–4 months of full-time studying or 4–5 months part-time.\n\nIf you have had some experience as a trader or investor, and are familiar with [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|financial assets]] (like [[Stocks]], [[Bonds]], [[Options]], [[Futures]], and [[Commodities]]) and [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|economics]] concepts, but you don’t have an in-depth understanding of [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|U.S. financial regulations]], then you could spend 2–3 months full-time, or 3–4 months part-time.\n\nIf you’ve previously worked in finance, and are familiar with [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|U.S. financial regulations]], as well as common [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|financial assets]] and basic [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|economics]], you might be able to get away with spending just 1–2 months of revision armed with a good textbook, like the [[notes/resources/kaplan|📖 Kaplan Series 65 Securities License Exam Manual]].\n\nThis is just a rule of thumb, however. Before commiting to a date for the exam, make sure you’re able to make progess at a comfortable pace, and factor in time you’ll need to revise (3–4 weeks).\n\n# ✌️ Split study into two phases\nThe exam is rich in concepts you have to deeply understand, as well as facts \u0026 figures you’ll just have to memorize. \n\nWe recommend splitting your study time into two phases: \n1. An initial study phase where ypu’re more concerned with deeply understanding the material, and dilligently notetaking followed by:\n2. A revision phase about 3–4 weeks before the exam where you’re focused on memorizing facts \u0026 figures, as well as doing as many practice exam questions as possible\n\n# 🔦 When revising, focus on highly-weighted topics\nAs you might have seen in the [[notes/topics/exam-outline|exam specifications]], not all topics are evenly weighted in the exam. \n\nAs such, you shouldn’t focus your study and revision time equally on all topics, as many of them will take a long time to study but aren’t heavily tested. Some units, like [[Tax Considerations]] or [[Insurance-Based Products]], will only see two questions appear on your exam, whereas the material is rich in facts \u0026 figures to memorize. These topics are not the best use of your time, as opposed to those with four or more questions.\n\nA simple trick to passing is to focus on revising those unis where most questions will appear, and out of those, those where you are most weak in.\n\nThe one topic you’ll absolutely want to memorize cover-to-cover is [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines]]. This topic is rich in questions as well as facts \u0026 figures that need to be memorized, such as dates, figures, exclusions, and exemptions.\n\nThe other topics that I recommend focusing on during the revision phase are:  \n- Calculations found in [[Financial Reporting]], [[Analytical Methods]], and [[Performance Measures]] (four questions each)\n- The different types of plans and their differences, in [[Retirement Plans Including ERISA Issues and Educational Funding Programs]] (a total of seven questions)\n\nSee also: [[notes/guides/memorization|Memorization Cheatsheet]]\n\n# 🔢 Order to study each topic\nDifferent [[notes/guides/buying-guide|textbooks]] present each of the four topics covered in the exam in a different order. There is no canonical order you should study in, since the concepts being tested are highly interweaved across all four topics.\n\nWhen studying, you’ll want to study in a way where concepts build on each other naturally. The way the topics are interweaved makes it difficult, but I’ve found the most natural order to be:\n\n1. [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|Investment Vehicle Characteristics]]\n2. [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|Economic Factors and Business Information]]\n3. [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]]\n4. [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]\n\nWhen revising, you’ll want to prioritize topics that are more heavily tested, as mentioned above. This lends us to this particular order\":\n\n1. [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]\n2. [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]]\n3.

You can pay for an additional 5 month extension (check their website)\n\n---\n\n# Where to buy\n\n### Direct from Kaplan\n\n\u003e [Buy direct from Kaplan →](https://www.kaplanfinancial.com/securities/series-65?select=2)\n\n### Amazon\nIf you prefer to buy from Amazon, the textbook is for sale there. However, please note that **the Amazon listing does not include access to the online question bank or study tools.**\n\n\u003e [Buy from Amazon (textbook only) →](https://amzn.to/3BssPP0)\n\n---\n# How I used the Kaplan to study\nI started using the Kaplan materials about a month before my exam, doing the practice tests for each section, the mock exam, and half of the weighted practice exams over the course of 3 weeks. \n\nBy following their study calendar, you can customize your study time to any time (3 weeks is the shortest recommended time).\n\nI ended up using up a quarter of the question bank toward the end of my revision. \n  \nEach day, I used their performance tracker to track down parts I was weak in and marked them in the exam manual and revised the relevant parts. Kaplan breaks it down all the way to a “learning objective”, so it makes targeted revision super easy.\n  \nAfter going through test questions section-by-section for a week, I became used to the way the questions were phrased and their gotchas. I was consistently scoring 80%+ on the practice exams, and scored 74% on the mock exam (the mock exam is a one-off exam that is a little harder than the practice questions and doesn’t reuse any of the questions from the test bank).  \n  \nThe actual test requires 73% to pass, so if you’re scoring higher than that on Kaplan, you should be good to go! The actual exam’s questions are phrased really similarly to the Kaplan practice questions, but they’re a lot easier than the Kaplan ones.","lastmodified":"2022-08-04T11:46:44.161841371Z","tags":null},"/notes/resources/pass-the-65":{"title":"Pass the 65","content":"\n![[notes/images/Pasted image 20220729201139.png]]\n\nAuthor: Robert M.

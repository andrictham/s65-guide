This isn‚Äôt an exam that can be passed with just a few weeks of revision, unless you‚Äôre already deeply familiar with the topics.\n\nIf you‚Äôve never worked in any capacity in finance, and are coming to this completely fresh, then you would want to budget about 3‚Äì4 months of full-time studying or 4‚Äì5 months part-time.\n\nIf you have had some experience as a trader or investor, and are familiar with [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|financial assets]] (like [[Stocks]], [[Bonds]], [[Options]], [[Futures]], and [[Commodities]]) and [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|economics]] concepts, but you don‚Äôt have an in-depth understanding of [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|U.S. financial regulations]], then you could spend 2‚Äì3 months full-time, or 3‚Äì4 months part-time.\n\nIf you‚Äôve previously worked in finance, and are familiar with [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|U.S. financial regulations]], as well as common [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|financial assets]] and basic [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|economics]], you might be able to get away with spending just 1‚Äì2 months of revision armed with a good textbook, like the [[notes/resources/kaplan|üìñ Kaplan Series 65 Securities License Exam Manual]].\n\nThis is just a rule of thumb, however. Before commiting to a date for the exam, make sure you‚Äôre able to make progess at a comfortable pace, and factor in time you‚Äôll need to revise (3‚Äì4 weeks).\n\n# ‚úåÔ∏è Split study into two phases\nThe exam is rich in concepts you have to deeply understand, as well as facts \u0026 figures you‚Äôll just have to memorize. \n\nWe recommend splitting your study time into two phases: \n1. An initial study phase where ypu‚Äôre more concerned with deeply understanding the material, and dilligently notetaking followed by:\n2. A revision phase about 3‚Äì4 weeks before the exam where you‚Äôre focused on memorizing facts \u0026 figures, as well as doing as many practice exam questions as possible\n\n# üî¶ When revising, focus on highly-weighted topics\nAs you might have seen in the [[notes/topics/exam-outline|exam specifications]], not all topics are evenly weighted in the exam. \n\nAs such, you shouldn‚Äôt focus your study and revision time equally on all topics, as many of them will take a long time to study but aren‚Äôt heavily tested. Some units, like [[Tax Considerations]] or [[Insurance-Based Products]], will only see two questions appear on your exam, whereas the material is rich in facts \u0026 figures to memorize. These topics are not the best use of your time, as opposed to those with four or more questions.\n\nA simple trick to passing is to focus on revising those unis where most questions will appear, and out of those, those where you are most weak in.\n\nThe one topic you‚Äôll absolutely want to memorize cover-to-cover is [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines]]. This topic is rich in questions as well as facts \u0026 figures that need to be memorized, such as dates, figures, exclusions, and exemptions.\n\nThe other topics that I recommend focusing on during the revision phase are:  \n- Calculations found in [[Financial Reporting]], [[Analytical Methods]], and [[Performance Measures]] (four questions each)\n- The different types of plans and their differences, in [[Retirement Plans Including ERISA Issues and Educational Funding Programs]] (a total of seven questions)\n\nSee also: [[notes/guides/memorization|Memorization Cheatsheet]]\n\n# üî¢ Order to study each topic\nDifferent [[notes/guides/buying-guide|textbooks]] present each of the four topics covered in the exam in a different order. There is no canonical order you should study in, since the concepts being tested are highly interweaved across all four topics.\n\nWhen studying, you‚Äôll want to study in a way where concepts build on each other naturally. The way the topics are interweaved makes it difficult, but I‚Äôve found the most natural order to be:\n\n1. [[notes/topics/investment-vehicle-characteristics|Investment Vehicle Characteristics]]\n2. [[notes/topics/economic-factors-business-information|Economic Factors and Business Information]]\n3. [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]]\n4. [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]\n\nWhen revising, you‚Äôll want to prioritize topics that are more heavily tested, as mentioned above. This lends us to this particular order:\n\n1. [[notes/topics/laws-regulations-guidelines-business-practices|Laws, Regulations, and Guidelines, Including Prohibition on Unethical Business Practices]]\n2. [[notes/topics/client-investment-recommendations-strategies|Client Investment Recommendations and Strategies]]\n3.

You can pay for an additional 5 month extension (check their website)\n\n---\n\n# Where to buy\n\n### Direct from Kaplan\n\n\u003e [Buy direct from Kaplan ‚Üí](https://www.kaplanfinancial.com/securities/series-65?select=2)\n\n### Amazon\nIf you prefer to buy from Amazon, the textbook is for sale there. However, please note that **the Amazon listing does not include access to the online question bank or study tools.**\n\n\u003e [Buy from Amazon (textbook only) ‚Üí](https://amzn.to/3BssPP0)\n\n---\n# How I used the Kaplan to study\nI started using the Kaplan materials about a month before my exam, doing the practice tests for each section, the mock exam, and half of the weighted practice exams over the course of 3 weeks. \n\nBy following their study calendar, you can customize your study time to any time (3 weeks is the shortest recommended time).\n\nI ended up using up a quarter of the question bank toward the end of my revision. \n  \nEach day, I used their performance tracker to track down parts I was weak in and marked them in the exam manual and revised the relevant parts. Kaplan breaks it down all the way to a ‚Äúlearning objective‚Äù, so it makes targeted revision super easy.\n  \nAfter going through test questions section-by-section for a week, I became used to the way the questions were phrased and their gotchas. I was consistently scoring 80%+ on the practice exams, and scored 74% on the mock exam (the mock exam is a one-off exam that is a little harder than the practice questions and doesn‚Äôt reuse any of the questions from the test bank).  \n  \nThe actual test requires 73% to pass, so if you‚Äôre scoring higher than that on Kaplan, you should be good to go! The actual exam‚Äôs questions are phrased really similarly to the Kaplan practice questions, but they‚Äôre a lot easier than the Kaplan ones.","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T14:03:08.937686856Z","tags":null},"/notes/resources/pass-the-65":{"title":"Pass the 65","content":"\n![[notes/images/Pasted image 20220729201139.png]]\n\nAuthor: Robert M.

An individual is known as a ‚Äúnatural person‚Äù. \n\n## Regulatory Bodies\nThis topic also focuses on how these firms and individuals are regulated by [regulatory bodies](/tags/regulatory-bodies) based in the United States. These regulatory bodies may be a federal government authority (national level) or a state authority.\n\n- [[notes/concepts/sec|Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)]]\n- [[notes/concepts/finra|Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] \n- [[notes/concepts/nasaa|North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)]]\n- [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrator]]\n\u003e [!info] The State Securities Administrator\n\u003e \n\u003e Because the exam is designed to license [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]], which are regulated by [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrators]], the exam places a heavy focus on the role and jurisdiction of the [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrator]]\n\n### Which regulatory bodies regulate each of the four [securities professionals](/tags/securities-professionals)?\n- [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Investment Advisers (IAs)]] and [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]] are regulated by:\n\t- [[notes/concepts/sec|Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)]] on the federal level\n\t- [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrator]] on the state level\n- [[notes/concepts/broker-dealers|Broker-Dealers (BDs)]] and [[notes/concepts/agent|Agents]] are regulated by:\n\t- [[notes/concepts/finra|FINRA]] on the federal level\n\t- [[notes/concepts/state-securities-administrator|State Securities Administrator]] on the state level\n### Registering with regulatory bodies\nAll [securities professionals](/tags/securities-professionals) are expected to be registered with a regulatory body, although some are either [[notes/concepts/exemptions-exclusions|exempt or excluded]] from registration under specific conditions. You must know what these conditions are, as you will be tested.\n\nYou must also know which of the four [securities professionals](/tags/securities-professionals) registers with which [regulatory bodies](/tags/regulatory-bodies).\n\n#### As a rule of thumb:\n- [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser|Investment Advisers (IAs)]] register *either* on the federal or state level, **never both**\n- [[notes/concepts/investment-adviser-representative|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]] only register on the state level\n- [[notes/concepts/broker-dealers|Broker-Dealers (BDs)]] register on the federal **and** state level\n- [[notes/concepts/agent|Agents]] register on the federal **and** state level\n\n## Regulations\nThese [regulatory bodies](/tags/regulatory-bodies) are responsible for administering certain regulations, to which [securities professionals](/tags/securities-professionals) are subjected at either the federal or state level. We will refer to these as [securities regulations](/tags/regulations).\n\nYou are expected to know how these laws apply to each of the four [securities professionals](/tags/securities-professionals).\n\n#### For this topic, the most important regulations to become familiar with are:\n- [[notes/regulations/uniform-securities-act|The Uniform Securities Act (USA)]]\n- [[notes/regulations/securities-act-1993|The Securities Act of 1933]]\n- [[notes/regulations/securities-exchange-act-1934|The Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]\n- [[notes/regulations/investment-advisers-act-1940|Investment Advisers Act of 1940]]\n- [[notes/regulations/upia|Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA)]]\n- [[notes/regulations/investment-company-act-1940|Investment Company Act of 1940]]\n\n\u003e [!summary] List of regulations covered in the Series 65\n\u003e \n\u003e See a list of all the [regulations](/tags/regulations) that will be tested in some form.","lastmodified":"2022-08-05T14:03:08.937686856Z","tags":null}}

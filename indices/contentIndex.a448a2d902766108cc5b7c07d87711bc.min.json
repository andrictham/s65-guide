{"/":{"title":"😇💰 Series 65 for Angels","content":"\n# What is this?\nThis is a companion guide / strategy guide to the [[notes/series-65-exam|NASAA Series 65 Exam]], otherwise known as the “Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam”. \n\nThis guide is written for anyone looking to pass this exam as a pre-requisite to invest in pre-IPO startups as an angel investor. \n\nBecause the exam was originally intended to license [[notes/concepts/iar|Investment Adviser Representatives (IARs)]], test prep resources you may find online are geared towards professionals working as IARs. This guide hopefully helps to fill in any conceptual gaps you might encounter while studying for this exam, if your professional background is not in investment advisory.\n\nThis guide is applicable to anyone looking to angel invest in U.S.-based startups, and don’t otherwise meet the other qualifications to be considered an “[[notes/concepts/accredited-investor|accredited investor]]”. Note: even if you’re a foreign investor, these still apply to you under United States securities laws.\n\n# New here?\n\u003e 📚 Get started with the [[notes/guides/master|Master Guide]]\n\n# How to use this site\nThis site is organized as a digital garden: all notes are linked to each other and shown in an interactive graph visualization.

Kaplan breaks it down all the way to a “learning objective”, so it makes targeted revision super easy.\n  \nAfter going through test questions section-by-section for a week, I became used to the way the questions were phrased and their gotchas. I was consistently scoring 80%+ on the practice exams, and scored 74% on the mock exam (the mock exam is a one-off exam that is a little harder than the practice questions and doesn’t reuse any of the questions from the test bank).  \n  \nThe actual test requires 73% to pass, so if you’re scoring higher than that on Kaplan, you should be good to go! The actual exam’s questions are phrased really similarly to the Kaplan practice questions, but they’re a lot easier than the Kaplan ones.","lastmodified":"2022-08-02T13:29:40.139999836Z","tags":null},"/notes/resources/pass-the-65":{"title":"Pass the 65","content":"\n![[notes/images/Pasted image 20220729201139.png]]\n\nAuthor: Robert M.
